Some rough notes for now!

For the past few days I've been hacking around getting a [simple Python implementation](http://mewo2.com/kaggle/2012/04/27/the-million-song-dataset-challenge-part-i/) 
running on my Laptop. Its been a little slow partly because I could get some of the libs needed running 
with the Apple provided Python on my MacBook. In the end I installed the ActiveState port.  

I've started researching Collaborative filtering algorithms
