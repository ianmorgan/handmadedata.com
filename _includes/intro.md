This is my little blog as I try to dive into the world of Hadoop, Data Science and Big Data. 

Its a diverse and exciting field. I need to dig out maths and stats from many summers past, I hope they are lying 
dormant in my subconscious; that flirtation with Baysenian logic wasn't wasted after all. And I plan to figure out 
map reduce, Hadoop and its little universe. Maybe I'll need some well written Java code to keep that cluster humming, hopefully I'm in 
familiar territory. There is 
language called R that keeps cropping up, and to be honest I really don't have the foggiest. Oh, I'm sure my 
minimal Python skills will be found wanting. 

Above all, I plan to keep an enquiring mind.

I'm fortunate to have some excellent user groups around here in London, including an active <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hadoop-users-group-uk/">Hadoop User Group</a> 
and the recent <a href="http://bigdataweek.com/">Big Data Week London</a>
